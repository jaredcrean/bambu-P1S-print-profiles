###I used the textured plate with Purple Glue Stick

Printer Tab
Under Extruder-Change Z Hop Type To Normal

Filament Tab
Do Flow Dynamics and make sure to input the result under this tab and check Pressure advance.  Do the flow rate test (The full test, not the Fine Calibration Option) and also Input That result under this Tab.  It often doesn't auto update so make sure you save it yourself.  For Flow Rate you want the number to be clearly visible and the overall surface smooth with no over or under extrusion.  The results will be different for each printer, don't just copy someone else's, it can damage your printer.
